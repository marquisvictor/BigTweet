# BigTweet

The BigTweet tool was built out of the need to eliminate the barriers that the Twitter API imposes so as to help researchers, businesses and organizations get all the tweets data they need for various analysis in their different line of operations, with ease and from command line, meaning no prior extensive programming knowledge is required. 
BigTweet provides a means of getting old/backdated twitter data for analysis, bypassing the rate limits and restrictions from twitter API, giving you unlimited tweet textual data along with some other metadata such as; dates and time information, likes, retweets, replies, and permalinks (unique link to a tweet).
